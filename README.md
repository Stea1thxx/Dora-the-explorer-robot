### Task list for Code

- [X] Add servo compatibiltiy to joystick
- [X] Make robot go back
- [X] Make robot able to turn
- [X] Film the robot using OBS and good visuals
- [ ] Fine tune the servos so that it does't move slightly left: Could maybe set the map to 1350 and 1650? They don't move much beyond those values
- [ ] Test robot for movement upon carpet
- [ ] Make git repo look nice
- [ ] See before capacitor using oscilloscope
